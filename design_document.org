* Design document for Real-Time LLM Interaction Project

** Project description:

AR software which allows the user to speak and then recieve a response
from an llm.

** Interface

The UI captures the camera view from a camera attached to a pair of
glasses to simulate AR. There are floating text prompts which tells
the user when they should speak and what the output of the LLM is.


** Design considerations:
- There should be an UI class: UserInterface which displays the camera view and text.
- Update llama_module to use Ollama.
